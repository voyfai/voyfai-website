  "Voyfai started in August 2023, but in many ways the story began years earlier. Before founding the company, we spent a long time inside the freight industry at Forto, working closely with the core management team. From that vantage point, we had a front-row seat to how global freight actually operates - the ambition, the complexity, the constant firefighting, and the people quietly holding it all together behind the scenes.",
  "What struck us most was that the industry isn't really dominated by giant multinational players in the way many outsiders assume. In fact, around three quarters of the market is made up of small and medium-sized freight forwarders. These are often family-built businesses that have spent decades earning trust customer by customer, shipment by shipment. They know their markets inside out. Their service levels are exceptional. Their relationships run deep.",
  "And yet, despite being the backbone of global logistics, they're forced to compete on an uneven playing field.",
  "While the largest players benefit from huge procurement leverage, sophisticated systems, and entire teams dedicated to automation and optimisation, smaller forwarders are still held together by spreadsheets, inboxes, WhatsApp groups, and sheer hard work. Technology was supposed to modernise logistics, but much of it was built for the largest enterprises, not for the businesses that make up the majority of the market.",
  "The more time we spent with these forwarders, the clearer it became: this wasn't a talent problem. It wasn't an ambition problem. The industry's best operators simply hadn't been given the same tools.",
  "That's why we built Voyfai.",
  "Our vision is to become the operating system for small and mid-sized freight forwarders - combining AI-driven workflow automation, access to best-in-class procurement through aggregated volumes, and a growing suite of value-added services designed specifically for how this industry actually works. But more importantly, we're building it alongside forwarders, not from a distance. We spend huge amounts of time with operators and their teams because the people closest to the problems are usually closest to the solutions too.",
  "At its core, Voyfai is about giving smaller forwarders the scale, efficiency, and technology that define best-in-class freight forwarding - without losing the relationships, expertise, and service culture that made them successful in the first place.",
  "Since those early days, the journey has moved faster than we could have imagined. We've been fortunate to attract an incredible team of people who genuinely believe in what we're building, and to partner with forwarders we're proud to work alongside every day. What started as an idea has now grown across six countries, and we still feel like we're only just getting started...",
